# Lab 1: Creating a Customized QnA Maker Bot

## Introduction

In this lab we will explore the QnA Maker for creating bots that connect to a pre-trained knowledge base.  Using QnAMaker, you can upload documents or point to web pages and have it pre-populate a knowledge base that can feed a simple bot for common uses such as frequently asked questions.

## Lab 1.1: QnA Maker Setup

1. In a web browser, navigate to ```https://portal.azure.com```. You will be redirected to sign-in page, use the credentials provided below for sign-in.
    * Azure Username/Email: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject>
    * Azure Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>.

2. Now in the azure portal, select **+ Create a Resource**

   > **Note**  Recent change in Azure requires dashes ("-") be removed from some resource names

1. Once the bot resource is created, navigate to the new **Web App Bot**, then select **Test in Web Chat**

   ![](./images/img22.png)

1. Ask the bot any questions related to a Surface Pro 4 or managing Azure Blog Storage:

      - How do I add memory?
      - How long does it take to charge the battery?
      - How do I hard reset?
      - What is a blob?

      ![](./images/img23.png)
      
1. Ask it some questions it doesn't know, such as:

- How do I bowl a strike?

## Lab 1.4: Download the Bot Source code

1. Under **Bot management**, select the **Build** tab

   ![](./images/img24.png)

1. Select **Download Bot source code**, when prompted select **Yes**.  

   ![](./images/img25.png)

   ![](./images/img30.png)

1. In visual studio expand QnABot file and open the **Startup.cs** file, you will notice nothing special has been added here

   ![](./images/img31.png)
   
   ![](./images/img32.png)

1. Open the **Bots/{BotName}.cs** file and review the code that was generated for this file

   ![](./images/img33.png)

1. Open the **BotService.cs** file and review the code that was generated for this file.

   ![](./images/img34.png)

[!NOTE] The previous steps for reviewing the generated code are correct for the solution that was downloaded during the authoring of this lab.  The solution files may change from time to time based on updates to the frameworks and SDKs so the solution files may differ.  The key aspect here is just have you review the code that is automatically generated from the tool.
